# Track Toaster

Track Toaster is a simple app that shows a popup "toast" on the screen showing you which track has just started playing. I use this on my in-car tablet install. I was unsatisfied with other solutions that used Android media database or online resources to obtain album art. I wanted something that would just work. This solution works every time, however, you do need to be disciplined in how you create your directory of audio files.

Your audio directory should be laid out like one of the following :-

     <artist>-<album>/albumart.jpg    
     <artist>/<album>/albumart.jpg
     <albumartist>-<album>/albumart.jpg
     <albumartist>/<album>/albumart.jpg
     Various Artists-<album>/albumart.jpg
     Various Artists/<album>/albumart.jpg
     Various-<album>/albumart.jpg
     Various/<album>/albumart.jpg
     <album>/albumart.jpg
     
     

Your media player will almost certainly use the ID3 information within the audio file to tell TrackToaster what's playing so it goes without saying, your tags should match your directory names. I personally use [Mp3Tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/) on Windows to manage my ID3 tags, to create the correct directory structure and to export albumart.jpg.

When you first start the program, make sure to go into the settings and choose your media directory. Currently it only supports one directory. Feel free to fork & modify if you like.

This is based on code from "Simple Last.fm Scrobbler (SLS)". Theoretically, it should support the same media players as SLS. I can only promise that it works for Poweramp.
